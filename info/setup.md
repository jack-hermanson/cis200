# Project Setup/Configuration

To set up the project to run on your local machine, 
you will need the following:

- Python
- A GitHub.com account
- An editor: VS Code (easiest to install), PyCharm (preferred)

## GitHub

Please go to [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com/) and sign up for an account.
I will invite you to be a collaborator on our repository.

## Mac Instructions

Python comes with the Mac OS. To make sure you have it,
open the "terminal" app on your machine.

### Step 1

Type the following into the command line:

```
python3 --version
```

Here's what I got:

This means I have Python version 3.9.7 installed.
If you don't have the same number, that's fine, as long as it's
at least 3.6 or so. 

### Step 2

Download [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

If you see a warning like this, click "Open".

Now log in with your GitHub.com credentials.

When you sign in online, you will probably see something like this:

![](authorize_github.png)

Click Authorize desktop.

Next, back in the GitHub desktop app, make sure your email
is the same one you used to sign up. You'll probably have 
to select it in the dropdown menu.

If you see a popups like these, just
do what they're asking you to do.

We'll come back to GitHub Desktop later.

### Step 3

Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Installing this 
should be pretty straightforward.

Now skip past the PC Instructions to [Cloning the Repository](#Cloning the Repository).

## PC Instructions

## Cloning the Repository

Back in GitHub desktop, you should see the following screen:

![](github_desktop_get_started.png)

Click the Clone button. If you accepted the invite,
you should see the `cis200` repository.

Switch branches to a new branch.

The naming pattern for branches is `lowercase-separated-by-dashes`.
Name this your `firstname-lastname` just as an example.
