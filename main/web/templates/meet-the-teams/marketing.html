                    <p>The Marketing team created several designs for the website, including logo designs, color
                        palette, and font selections. The team used a variety of software (e.g., Adobe Photoshop, GIMP)
                        to create the designs. Using Qualtrics, the team surveyed the two sections of CIS200 to
                        determine the most preferred designs. After analyzing the results of the survey, the Marketing
                        team shared the top website and logo designs with the IS team for implementation. The Marketing
                        team began planning the external marketing campaign using creative briefs and launching an
                        Instagram page for the website. They also met with the Marketing Director of CSU’s College of
                        Business to learn professional strategies and policy constraints related to publishing and
                        marketing the website.</p>

                    <h5>A Letter to the Next Marketing Team</h5>
                    <p> As a whole, the Marketing team agrees that this project was a great overall experience.
                        It taught us how to work together as a team, accomplish goals with a proper deadline and
                        timeline, and gain overall experience in what marketing a website could potentially look like.

                    <p>
                        Working with strangers was tough at first. Communication is everything, and we did
                        struggle with that. For the next Marketing team, we suggest getting into contact with everybody
                        on your team as soon as possible so everyone can stay in the loop. Also, talk to other
                        groups. Stay connected with one another, share your ideas and ask questions; this will only
                        benefit your team's work and the website as a whole.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your goal with this project is to work together effectively and efficiently. It is a great way to
                        gain experience in your career field since almost everyone will be working with a team. Take
                        this
                        project seriously. The more you and your team work together to the best of your abilities, the more it
                        should be an easy, fun learning experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to this project being the first for Dr. Serrano and her students, we had plenty more to
                        finish. You will have a more thought-out schedule and approach. With that being said, we
                        suggest using creative briefs and/or other layouts to help get you started and help you and your
                        team decide on what you want your marketing experience to be like. Remember, this is meant
                        to benefit you, so have fun with it!
