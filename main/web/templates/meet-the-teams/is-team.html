                            <div>"Overall, this website project allowed for students with zero experience in
                                programming/web development to develop many useful skills. Not only were students able
                                to gain an understanding in the way websites are coded and developed, but we also gained
                                experience in working/communicating with multiple different teams. Development of
                                technical skillsets are very important, but one thing that is often overlooked in
                                college is the development of teamwork, leadership, and other important soft skills.
                                This project provided students a perfect opportunity to get a feel for a real-world
                                multi-team environment, and I'm very grateful to have had the opportunity to be a part
                                of it."</div>

                            <div>“..., this semester held some valuable lessons, such as learning how to effectively
                                work in a team of people you don’t know, how to utilize feedback to grow rather than to
                                become defensive, and how students can learn skills to create something that is greater
                                than themselves--a website that will influence a large audience rather than just a
                                project the professor sees. The experiential learning done in the classroom through our
                                website was something I’m glad we did because I learned a lot more applicable skills
                                rather than just textbook information. For example, I now know the basics of coding my
                                own website. I never thought I would learn how to code anything, but I’m proud of myself
                                for knowing how to now. I also found myself enjoying the process of coding.”</div>

                            <div>“I felt like I was actually doing something being on the IS Team. To me, whenever I
                                would fall behind with my team deliverables, I would feel bad, but more so because I
                                felt like I was letting my team down instead of just not getting a good grade. I
                                honestly really feel like I was immersed into a scenario that was very close to what the
                                real business world is like”</div>

                            <div>The goal of this website is to be expanded on by future classes. The purpose of future
                                IS Teams will be to further develop and expand on the <a
                                    href="{{ url_for('main.mission_and_vision') }}">Mission and Vision</a> of the
                                website. Even though the initial development has already been completed, there is still
                                a lot of room for growth for future IS Teams. With the development of new projects by
                                Multimedia teams, IS Teams will need to learn more efficient ways to organize and
                                consolidate past projects, as well as expand on the interactive development/design of
                                the website. </div>

                            <div>The beauty of this project is that it allows future team members to develop and apply
                                their personal ideas into the website. One example is to look into web accessibility. A
                                function we should
                                incorporate into the website would be alternative (alt) text options for the disabled.
                                This would allow users to
                                read the text on the screen using a synthesizer or Braille display.</div>
