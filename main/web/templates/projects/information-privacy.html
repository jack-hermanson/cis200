                <p>Each year, hundreds of millions of individuals experience their data being leaked or breached.
                    Identity theft accounts for nearly 65 percent of data breaches globally. Many major companies report
                    being affected by data breaches and other cybercrimes, with trillions of dollars of losses annually.
                </p>
                <p>It's imperative for companies to ensure their business, employees, and customers are protected from
                    data breaches. Not only is this important for ethical reasons, but also for protecting the company's
                    reputation and maintaining trust and loyalty from its customers. </p>
                <p>Our video highlights these grave issues and discusses several major data breaches that should serve
                    as cautionary tales for all organizations.</p>
