                    Our team interviewed Mr. Doug Burian, a U.S. Marine Corps Major who lost thousands of dollars as a
                    victim to this cybercrime. Because this can happen to anyone with a checking account, our team opted
                    to present Mr. Burian's interview as a news story, as we believe his story needs to be heard.</p>

                <p>Many financial information systems do not automatically flag electronic funds tranfer amounts
                    under $5,000, so cybercriminals will transfer amounts around or right under $5,000 to avoid these
                    alerts. You should check your daily transfer limits at your bank to determine how many times a
                    cybercriminal could set up electronic funds transfers of around $5,000 from your banking accounts
                    without hitting your bank's daily limit.</p>

                <p>Mr. Doug Burian engaged in extensive information gathering to learn what happened to his money.
                    Through his research, he discovered the unauthorized transfers were for the purposes of money
                    laundering and
                    that the out-of-state account where his money was transferred belonged to banking customers who were
                    also likely defrauded from the cybercrime. To learn more about Mr. Burian's story, you can read

                </p>
                <p>We thank Mr. Burian for sharing his story, which we can all learn from to engage in more secure
                    banking. Our team is also grateful to CSU's Collegian TV (CTV) for allowing us to use their news
                    room studio for our recording.</p>
