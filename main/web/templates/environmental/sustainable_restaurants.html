                <h5 class="card-title">The Issue:</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Over 20 billion pounds of food is wasted each year in the Restaurant Industry in the United States. According to 303 Magazine, “Over 40% of what we produce in the US [is] thrown away and not used. This is enough to feed everyone who lives in the US and not wasting food could end hunger tomorrow”.This is a large issue in the restaurant industry that needs to be addressed. According to Restaurant Hospitality “The restaurant industry alone generates about 11.4 million tons of food waste annually at a cost of about $25 billion per year”. We are addressing the issues of food waste, sustainability, and the use of locally sourced foods within the restaurant industry. Businesses will oftentimes choose the cheap option over the sustainable option, but that doesn’t have to be the case. </p>

                <h5 class="card-title">The Solution:</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Our concept is a “Greenhouse restaurant.” A locally sourced restaurant could be built that would be surrounded by greenhouses. The food that would be used in most of the meals would come from the greenhouses. The greenhouses themselves would be powered by solar energy and the panels would be located on the outside of each one. Most of the food waste from the restaurant would be composted and used in the soil to grow all of the produce. The meat and dairy products used in the restaurant would come from local farms in the area of Fort Collins to support the underrepresented farms that grow locally sourced food. There are restaurants that are locally sourced or farm to table that exist, but they don’t directly grow their products on site. There are also restaurants that have greenhouse seating, but these restaurants aren’t contributing towards sustainability or food waste. The reduction in food waste will also create savings to help offset the other costs related  to sustainability. This greenhouse restaurant would be a fun, interactive restaurant that would help with the issues of sustainability and food waste in the restaurant industry. </p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Interviews:</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Our group identified a specific customer segment to interview to see if the “Greenhouse Restaurant” concept would be intriguing to consumers. The customer segment that our group identified are people that are environmentally friendly and implement sustainable practices in their everyday lives. We identified this as our customer segment to interview because the overall goal of the “Greenhouse Restaurant” is to improve the issues of sustainability, food waste, and locally sourced foods in the restaurant industry. A large majority of our initial customers will be people that care about these issues and want to improve the environment.</p>
                <h5>Katie Lennie- Environmental Engineering Major</h5>
                <p>How important are sustainable practices to you?
                    “They are very important to me and I try my best to practice them everyday. It’s important to me because everyone needs to do their part to impact the large issues on sustainability. One person isn’t going to make a difference but if everyone incorporates sustainable practices in their day to day lives then it will make a difference. It also affects future generations.”
                    What kind of sustainable practices do you incorporate in your day to day life?
                    “Recycling, composting, reusable water bottles, reusable coffee mugs, reusable grocery bags.”
                    How much food waste do you think is produced in the restaurant industry each year?
                    “70 million pounds”
                    Would you be willing to pay a slightly higher cost for a higher quality dish?
                    “I would be willing to pay more because I think it’s going to a larger cause but as long as it isn’t too much money.”
                    How does the ambience of a restaurant impact the way you experience it?
                    “It’s everything. The quality of the food is important but the experience and the vibe plays a big role in your dining experience.”
                    What’s your opinion on interactive restaurants?
                    “I think that they’re very fun because they’re more unique.”
                    What’s the most important aspect of your dining experience and why?
                    “The food and the atmosphere because both are important. You have to have one or the other for a restaurant to be good.”
                    Are you familiar with the benefits of locally sourced foods?
                    “Yes I am, they reduce gas emissions and help local farms.”
                    Do you feel as though local farms are underrepresented in the restaurant industry? Can you elaborate on that?
                    “Yes they are. Many restaurants buy from commercial farms because they are cheaper. This doesn't support the local farmers whereas buying locally sourced food does.”
                    If this option (Greenhouse Restaurant) was available to you, would you be a customer?
                    “Yes, because I think that it’s a great idea that this business is trying to be sustainable so I want to show my support because a lot of businesses don’t care as much.”
