            <p class="lead">
                Emboldened to not only <span class="fw-bold fst-italic">learn about</span> harnessing business for a
                better world, Colorado State University
                students in CIS200 decided to <span class="fw-bold fst-italic">actively engage</span> in projects that
                better the world.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                During Fall 2021,
                CIS200 students imagined, designed, and built this website to showcase student-driven projects that
                highlight business sustainability challenges and solutions. Students agreed that weâ€™re living in a time
                when fact-based information can be hard to come by, so they prioritized the presentation of
                evidence-based content on this website, implementing peer review and vetting peer-reviewed sources.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Furthermore, by engaging in the process of designing and constructing this website, students were able
                to gain hands-on experience with the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC), including Scrum, an agile
                methodology.
