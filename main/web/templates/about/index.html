            <p>
                Emboldened to not only <span class="fw-bold fst-italic">learn about</span> harnessing business for a
                better world, Colorado State University
                students in CIS200 decided to <span class="fw-bold fst-italic">actively engage</span> in projects that
                better the world. During Fall 2021,
                CIS200 students imagined, designed, and built this website to showcase student-driven projects that
                highlight business sustainability challenges and solutions. Students agreed that weâ€™re living in a time
                when fact-based information can be hard to come by, so they prioritized the presentation of
                evidence-based content on this website, implementing peer review and vetting peer-reviewed sources.
                Furthermore, by engaging in the process of designing and constructing this website, students were able
                to gain hands-on experience with the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC), including Scrum, an agile
                methodology.

            <h3>Mission and Vision</h3>
            <p>
                The aims of the website are to educate the public about sustainability issues that span environmental,
                social, and economic domains and to encourage the community to become more engaged in sustainability
                initiatives in Colorado and beyond. Designed to be a sustainable project, the website will be maintained
                and expanded by CIS200 students in future semesters to maintain timely and high-quality content.
