# CIS 200 Website

This website runs on the `flask` framework for Python.

### Running the project

1. Install Python 3. 
[Mac Instructions](https://programwithus.com/learn/python/install-python3-mac).
[PC Instructions](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-windows).
If you're on a PC, make sure you check the "add to path" box.
You may need to restart your computer.
2. Install GitHub Desktop.
3. Sign into GitHub Desktop with your GitHub account. Make sure you use the right email,
not some weird autogenerated one.
4. Install an editor. VS Code is fine, but I prefer PyCharm. PyCharm takes a little bit longer
to install because you have to make an educational account to get it for free.
5. Clone this repository.
6. Open up a terminal. In the root directory of the project, run the following commands.

First Time on Mac:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

After First Time on Mac:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python run.py
```

First Time Windows:
```powershell
py -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
python run.py
```

After First Time on Windows:
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python run.py
```
