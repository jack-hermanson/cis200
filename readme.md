# CIS 200 Website

This website runs on the `flask` framework for Python.

### Running the project

1. If you are on a PC, install Python. If you're on a Mac, it's already installed.
If you're on a PC, make sure you check the "add to path" box.
2. Install GitHub Desktop.
3. Sign into GitHub Desktop with your GitHub account. Make sure you use the right email,
not some weird autogenerated one.
4. Install an editor. VS Code is fine, but I prefer PyCharm. PyCharm takes a little bit longer
to install because you have to make an educational account to get it for free.
5. Clone this repository.
6. Open up a terminal. In the root directory of the project, run the following commands.

Mac:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install
python run.py
```

Windows:
```powershell
python --version

```
